# Miner

> A simple non-competitive Minecraft minigame I made back in 2015 which rewards you for mining ores.

Miner provides you a Prison-like experience, giving you monetary rewards in a randomly generated arena for mining ores. This is a fun minigame that can give your players a nice way to relax when they want to earn some extra cash.
